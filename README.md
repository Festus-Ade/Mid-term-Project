# Goals of the project

## **Do data cleaning:**
    - identify and remove where applicable the outliers, missing data, duplicates, columns to drop
    - decide on the interesting features to keep
## **Carry out EDA and provide dataset summary:** 
    - Mean prices
    - max prices 
    - mode i.e most frequent car model
## **Investigate the underlying patterns and data structure:** 
    - Commonly listed brands
    - distribution of brands?
    - price variation between: 
        - relatively newer cars and older cars
        - fuel type
        - transmission type

        - milage of the car
        - unrepaired_damage
    - correlations between the numerical features:
        - Price
        - power_ps 
        - milage in Km
## **Assess the impact of Ab Testing:**
    - Viewership of the cars
## **Business Inteligence - Build a Tableau Dashboard:**
    - Are their any meaningful KPIs?
